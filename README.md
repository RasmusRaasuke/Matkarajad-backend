Java Spring-Boot application for our project.

## Camping routes (Matkarajad)
We are creating an application to find new and rate old camping routes.
It is a way for people to show their love towards nature and camping.
It also gives the possibility to share good experiences.

## Technologies
We are using Spring-Boot with Gradle. For the database we will use PostGreSQL with LiquiBase.
